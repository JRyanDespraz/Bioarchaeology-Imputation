#Step 1: calculate the number of components
#make sure R is reading the categorical variables as factors and the quantitative variables as numeric
ncp.FAMD <- estim_ncpFAMD(dataset)

#Step 2: Impute
imputed_FAMD <- imputeFAMD(dataset, ncp = ncp.FAMD$ncp, seed = 99, maxiter = 1000)

#get the matrix with $completeObs
final_imputed_dataset <- imputed_FAMD$completeObs
